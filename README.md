# Space Shooter Game (Arduino-Based)

Welcome to my motion-controlled **Space Shooter** project built using an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, and a Nokia 5110 LCD display!

## Project Overview

This is a fully interactive shooter game where the player's spaceship is controlled via hand gestures measured by an ultrasonic sensor. Obstacles approach at increasing speeds and difficulty as levels progress, challenging players to adapt to changing controls.
